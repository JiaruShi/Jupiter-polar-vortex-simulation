Modified code of GeophysicalFlows.jl and FourierFlows.jl for simulating the equivalent-barotropic system (1 and 1/2 layer QGPV model) on a gamma-plane.
To use the code, paste the file singlelayerqg.jl to the src directory under the path of the GeophysicalFlows package, and paste the file domains.jl to the src directory under the path of the FourierFlows package.
